# Fake news detection based on the induction of fuzzy sets
This git repository shows the work of Giovanni Laganà's final thesis of his master's degree at Università degli Studi di Milano, about the extension of the algorithm described in [1], observing how the choice of input formatting techniques [2] will affect the learning results, focusing on the problem of detecting the reliability score of news published on online newspapers.

# Repository structure
This repository is structured as follows:
- <i>modules</i>:
    * ```main_kaggle.py```: the module which downloads the dataset from Kaggle
    * ```main_preprocessing.py```: the module that runs a preprocessing pipeline
    * ```main_model_selection.py```: the module that select the best model through a grid search
    <!-- * ```main_experiment.py```: the module that launches the experiments and stores them in a .csv file" -->
    * ```main_results_viewer.py```: the module that reads the experiments from the .csv file generated by the previous module

- <i>classes</i>:
    <!-- * ```experiment.py```: the class responsible for creating, fitting and using a predicitive model through the [mulearn](https://github.com/dariomalchiodi/mulearn) package -->
    * ```model.py```: the class for the models that we want to build and use
    * ```ppsteps.py```: the class that implements fit and transform functions, according to scikit-learn's [convention](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/develop.html)
    * ```preprocessing.py```: the class to configure the preprocessing pipeline with the operations that we want 
    
    Note: these files are grouped in ```classes``` folder.
- <i>test</i>:
    * ```test_ppsteps.py```: the file where unitary tests for ```ppsteps.py``` are executed
    
- generated files (not shown in this repository):
    * ```datasets/fakeandreal/Fake.csv, True.csv```: the two files from the dataset loaded from Kaggle
    * ```preprocessed_datasets/```: the folder containing the preprocessed datasets
    * ```images/```: the folder containing all scatterplots generated by the experiments
    <!-- * ```results/experiments.csv```: the dataframe containing the configuration of experiments and their results -->
    * ```selected_models/models.csv```: the dataframe containing the selected models

# Datasets (updated on 29/06/2020)
Currently, two main interesting datasets about web news have been found.
1. [Fake and real news dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset?select=Fake.csv), 111 MB
2. [All the News 2.0](https://components.one/datasets/all-the-news-2-news-articles-dataset/), 9.2 GB 

# Datasets loading
The two datasets presented in the section above are not included in this repository to avoid inefficiency.
The module ```main_kaggle.py``` automatically downloads data from Kaggle (currently this is done for dataset 1). 
Before executing the code, please, configure the Kaggle's API by the following steps:

* make sure to have Python 3 installed and correctly configured
* install the Kaggle's API by typing in console ```pip3 install kaggle```
* register to the Kaggle website
* go to ```https://www.kaggle.com/<username>/account``` and click the button "Create New API Token"
* the file downloaded in the previous step (```kaggle.json```) contains the credentials to login to the kaggle website: do not share with anyone
* Move this file to ```~/.kaggle/``` folder in Mac and Linux (if not present just create it) or to ```C:\Users\.kaggle\``` on windows.
Alternatively, you can populate KAGGLE_USERNAME and KAGGLE_KEY environment variables with values from kaggle.json to get the api to authenticate.

For any doubts, i recommend to read this very good [guide](https://technowhisp.com/kaggle-api-python-documentation/).

When all steps above are done, you can safely run ```main_kaggle.py```.
This script has the effect of creating a folder ```datasets/fakeandreal``` in your repository. 
This folder contains two .csv files, respectively about fake and real news.

# Dataset Preprocessing
Once your data is loaded into ```datasets``` folder, you can run ```main_preprocessing.py```.
This module has the effect of generating preprocessed datasets divided into training and test sets in ```preprocessed_datasets/train, test``` folders.

# Model Selection
Assuming you have preprocessed cleaned dataset in ```preprocessed_datasets``` folder, you can run ```main_model_selection.py``` in order to perform a grid search such that the optimal configuration can be obtained.
Once the configuration is found, a model is created and is directly stored in ```selecte_models/models.csv``` file.
Moreover, in this module models are evaluated by computing some metrics like Precision, Recall, F1 and a confusion matrix.


<!--
# Experiments
If you want to launch the final experiments to see results, you have to run ```main_experiment.py``` which selects a model from ```selected_models/models.csv``` and run an experiment on the test set.
Whenever the plot flag is enabled, scatterplots are saved in ```images``` folder.
All experiments are saved in ```results/experiments.csv``` file.
-->

# Display of Results
When you want to display final results, you can run ```main_results_viewer.py``` to show the experiments outcome.
